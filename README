fizzle.js

Fizzle is a port of the Sizzle CSS Selector engine to E4X
(http://www.ecma-international.org/publications/standards/Ecma-357.htm).

Why would anyone do this? Well, I'd like to eventually build a templating
engine based solely around javascript and HTML. Basically a backend module
that executes javascript to manipulate HTML. And why would anyone want that?
For me, personally, this seems like a wide spread enough problem that everyone
seems to have their own solution. Everything from mixing code and content to
strict separation of code and content. And typically those technologies
require you to learn some new DSL that is uglier than a poop oozing diaper (I'm
looking at you TT).

It sucks. I want something that will enable the designers and front end UI
people I worth with to be able to massage their own templates using the skills
they already have, javascript and HTML.

Fizzle is the first step toward that goal. jQuery unfortunately does not work
without a DOM present (ie. a web browser). But the CSS selectors are awesome.
That is where Sizzle comes into the picture. Sizzle is what jQuery uses under
the hood to do its CSS selecting. So in order to be able to have slick CSS 
selectors for my future backend environment (and more easily transition those
front end UI skills to the backend), I took a chainsaw to the guts of Sizzle
so that it will work absent a DOM.

Thus, Fizzle was born. 

Will Fizzle ever become more than just a CSS selector that works against E4X?
Unlikely. But, I am thinking I will make a very simple, naive port of the
manipulations in jQuery to work with E4X and blend in Fizzle.

Thanks to The Dojo Foundation for releasing their code under Free Software
licenses.
